# Tourist Bureau

This project is a website for the local visitor's bureau that will help tourists explore all the things to do in the area. If they find an excursion they like, they can buy "e-tickets" directly from the site.

##### Activities Page
When the activities page loads:
![activities-page-1](/images/activities-page-1.jpg)

When the user chose a category, the list of activities will then show:
![activities-page-2](/images/activities-page-2.jpg)

When an activity was selected, the details will show below. If the price is $0.00, there will be no form:
![activities-page-3](/images/activities-page-3.jpg)

A form will appear below the details section when the price is more than $0.00; allowing the user to buy e-tickets on the same page:

There's also validation for the form:
